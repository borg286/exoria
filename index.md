# Survival

## Uncategorized Tips

* Poison doesn't kill you

* You can get Planks/Sticks from the Chopping Block at a lower chance if you use your hands

* Don't throw Ash away, you will need lots of it later. Compact 4 ash into a block for storage

* Vanilla Immersion Crafting Table

    * You can drag on the Vanilla Immersion Crafting Table to spread items

    * Shift and drag to split stacks evenly

    * Shift left click output to craft as many as it can instead of 1

    * The Vanilla Immersion crafting tables have JEI support, click the "question mark" icon to bring up the interface.

* Press "K" while hovering over items to compress them (like Ash to Ash Blocks)

    * Without a crafting table with a gui, this will be limited to 2x2 recipes.

* You don't need an empty hand to "dig" through blocks

* The strainer base can be used as a chest by throwing items on top to insert them, useful for items like seeds which are difficult to stack in the immersive chest

## Exploration

* Ideally, you want to find a flat space with nearby access to water to settle down in. 

* Before leaving spawn, right click the waystone to active it

* There are 2 different structures you can come across in the world. A small Botania area which you will need eventually. But, the major benefits come in the form of loot, specifically the Astral Sorcery conversion and formation wand, and the horn of the canopy. With the conversion wand, you can select something such as saplings (throw ash into elven portal for more saplings) which allows you to instantly mine a large area of blocks. In conjunction with the horn of the canopy this makes tree farming very quick and easy.

* The other structure is a small Roots 2 setup. No major loot like the botania area. Both structures should also have a waystone (which you can mine), allowing easy tp access.

## Automation

[Something about the water filters and how they produce more based on placement and stream level] [Some recommended configuration, with a note about future automation of filters]

[Talk about the automation possible with hoppers for refilling the filters, as well as filling a chest's slots with 1-5 items (1 item per slot so the hopper has to send it to the next hopper) so as to make a poor-manâ€™s sorting system
