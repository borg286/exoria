# Survival

## Uncategorized Tips

* Stepup is on by default. This can be changed in the controls under the category "StepUp" which will toggle between the Vanilla auto-jump, stepup, and off.

## Survival Tips

* Poison doesn't kill you

    * Be careful of fall damage if you only have ½ heart though

    * You will get poison if you go outside when its raining

* Your player will sink slightly into the ash. This means sneaking over pools of lava will cause you to catch fire. Similarly, in acid pools you will take damage.

* Rocks can be thrown with right click and used as a primitive long range weapon against fairies

    * Roots 2 Fairies = Roots 2 *fairy dust*

    * Biomes O' Plenty Pixies = Botania *pixie dust*

    * Astral Sorcery Sparks = Botania *spark*

* Nutrition food tips

    * Carbs

        * *Baguettes* can be crafted with 3 wheat

        * *Ground wheat* can be made from 1 wheat, a rock, and a stone basin (not consumed), then smelted into bread

    * Fat

        * *Cookies* are cheap and provide fat and carbs

        * *Zombie flesh* can be dried into *dry jerky* or cooked into *flesh*

        * *Onion rings* are made by cooking an *onion* in a furnace

    * Protein

        * Piles of *fish* from strainers

        * *Dried fish* can be eaten at full hunger, restores 8 shanks of saturation

    * Vitamin

        * *Rush seeds* can be eaten even at full hunger

## Quality of Life Tips

* Incase you don't have another hatchet/axe, you can get Planks/Sticks from the Chopping Block at a lower chance if you use your hands.

* Use a hopper to insert wood into the chopping block.

* Don't throw Ash away, you will need **lots** of it later. Compact 4 ash into a block for storage.

    * Ash blocks can also be used as a fuel for smelting, saving on wood and by extension, charcoal

    * There are many ways to obtain large quantities of Ash on a single trip:

        * If you have begun sifting, you can make EFLNs for 1 flint and 1 sulfur, which lets you clear large areas of Ash blocks without destroying the drops.

        * If you have access to Exoria Underground, you can make cheap stone excavators for slower but less destructive gathering.

        * If you have the conversion wand from the Botania hut, you can replace Ash blocks with Basalt which you are able to clear quickly with the Bane of Cobble.

    * Bring a trash buffer, item vacuum and lever with you to suck up and hold all the Ash (32 stacks of 1024 items each, doesn't lose its contents when broken) 

* Press "K" while hovering over items to compress them (like Ash to Ash Blocks)

    * Without a crafting table with a gui, this will be limited to 2x2 recipes.

* Vanilla Immersion Crafting Table

    * You can drag on the Vanilla Immersion Crafting Table to spread items

    * Shift and drag to split stacks evenly

    * Shift left click output to craft as many as it can instead of 1

    * Right click output to craft a full stack

    * The Vanilla Immersion crafting tables have JEI support, click the "question mark" icon to bring up the interface.

* You don't need an empty hand to "dig" through blocks. Do not dig with the same hand collecting things like mudballs, you will throw them.

* The strainer base can be used as a chest by throwing items on top to insert them, useful for items like seeds which are difficult to stack in the immersive chest

* Immersive Craft shelves are probably the cheapest early-game storage option only requiring 7 wooden slabs. They hold as much as an IC chest or cupboard, but don't need trapdoors. The shelves also do not have a lid.

* Water from Magneticraft sluice boxes can be chained together, saving on precious water.

* Vanilla Concrete is fast to walk on. 

* Once you are able to make a stone gallagher, you can (very cheaply) use flaked obsidian to make an obsidian hatchet to chop 8 Wood Planks per log. Later on, the flexible axe gives you 10 Wood Planks per log. 

* Don't worry about the vanilla crafting tables and early chests, access to metals and crafting unlocks the tinker table and chests (and tin, gold, diamond chests).

* Rushes are an excellent source of plant fiber and twine. Plant them somewhere accessible, but off to the side. 

* Build your base with the intention to expand.

* Hammer a bone to get four bonemeal. Three bonemeal + one rotten flesh = instant growth bonemeal.!

* Coconut trees have four spots where coconuts grow (diagonal spaces from top center leaf block. If you bonemeal those spotst, 1-2 coconuts will grow over the next 15 seconds. Chop down the entire tree.

* Turn the extra fish from your strainers into fish bait and put a stack into Primalcore Fish Traps. Right-click on them to get slime balls, flint->diamond flakes, lily pads, more fish, diamonds, etc.

* You can take the urushi out of the cauldron and make your lacquered planks in a crafting table. Much faster.

* rice slimeballs (requiring 6 rice and a water bucket) can be used to craft tinkers construct slime boots and slime sling. These (especially the boots) are near essential for effective travel

## Exploration Tips

* Ideally, you want to find a flat space with nearby access to water to settle down in.

* Before leaving spawn, right click the waystone to active it

    * Waystones can be renamed by shift right clicking them

![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/1oDoqFSny61tSQxEXLouug_img_1.png)

* There are 2 different structures you can come across in the world. A small Botania area which you will need eventually. But, the major benefits come in the form of loot, specifically the Astral Sorcery conversion and formation wand, and the horn of the canopy. With the conversion wand, you can select something such as dead saplings (throw ash into elven portal for more saplings) which allows you to instantly mine a large area of blocks. In conjunction with the horn of the canopy, this makes tree farming very quick and easy.

![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/1oDoqFSny61tSQxEXLouug_img_2.png)

* The other structure is a small Roots 2 setup. No major loot like the botania area, but you will need the rune stone.. Both structures should also have a waystone (which you can mine), allowing easy teleport access.

* There are also other Botania Portals out there for more Guilty Mana Pools.

* Exoria Underground has Shulkers (drops shells) , Vexes (drops sulfur and (Bat) Wings), Silverfish (drops silver nuggets) and Ancient Golems (low Y levels, drops Archaic Bricks and Ancient Motive Cores)

* Find a few extra Waystones and take them with you into other dimensions. Use them to replace your portals. Suggest putting them near bedrock, that is where all the action is.

* Once you have built the Botania Alchemy Catalyst turn rotten flesh into leather and build an OpenBlock Glider to get around much faster.

## Progression Tips

* After making a strainer, the Bane of X tools are very useful and unbreakable

    * The Bane of Cobble lets you mine cobblestone directly from a cobblestone generator instead of getting rocks

        * Does not have to be an actually cobblestone generator. A cobble with lava and water adjacent to it is all it checks for

    * The Bane of Leaves acts as a mega shear

    * The Bane of Trees is a quick lumber axe

* The Foundry quest needs 17 copper ingots (153 copper rocks, ~2½ stacks), which can feel like a lot in the early game. It's best to start automating the strainers as soon as you can

    * Make 2 extra ingots for the saw you'll need to make stone slabs

* Quests with a fancy border indicate the quests needed for progression while those with a plain square outline are generally not required  [pic]

* Flexible Tools require a lot of gold, diamond, or obsidian to repair. Use OpenBlock Tanks to collect lava, use an Immersive Engineering drain (with only one input and output) to dump it into the space below water block to make obsidian and break that with the Embers breaker. Have a hopper below the obsidian to collect drops.

## Automation Tips

![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/1oDoqFSny61tSQxEXLouug_img_3.png)

* Strainers are most effective when adjacent to a source block flowing into itself (+10%)

* Strainers lose significant efficiency (-15%) when placing them within a 1 block radius (including diagonals) of another strainer

    * Only horizontally, strainers do not check for other strainers vertically

* Gravity feed pipes act as a super fast extraction pipe that only works when placed on the underside of a block. Perfect for pulling products out of a strainer without needing a clunky redstone engine + lever powering a wooden extraction pipe.

* When setting up the auto sifter (Ex Nihilo Creatio), build the axles and water wheels off of the sifter, because placement matters and it won't work if the wheels/axles are turned the wrong way.

* Have a dedicated crucible for seed oil, you're going to need quite a bit in order to make impregnated casings.

    * Make large farms for rushes for fiber and hemp for string, toss the seeds into the crucible

## Metals

* Adobe drying is quite slow, its best to make a few brick form molds

* Most nugget-ingot-block conversion is disabled, so keep that in mind when casting metals

    * For example, iron nuggets for vanilla chests

* Copper ore rock is the only ore rock that can be directly smelted in a furnace for copper nuggets

* Oreberry bushes are relatively easy to get and are an infinite source of ores. Place a slab above and in front to leave a gap to click on the shrub, Line your walkways and grab them as you see them.

![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/1oDoqFSny61tSQxEXLouug_img_4.png)

* After getting access to iron, the Magneticraft shelving unit acts as a poor man's centralized inventory. It needs to be filled with chests (up to 24 split across 3 layers, 8 chests per layer). Clicking anywhere on a layer will let you see the contents of all 8 chests in that layer, and let you switch the view to another layer

* After getting access to processing gold, making a backpack from fiber (rushes) and a gold plate is very cheap, and you can open it with a hotkey from anywhere in your inventory.  It can also be expanded to a rather large size with up to six backpack pockets that you put in the backpack and right click for one extra row each.

* The Terraqueous CraftBench and CraftFurnace act as upgraded versions of their respective blocks

    * The CraftBench has a 27 slot inventory, and can autocraft faster than the BC Factory Auto Workbench (depends on the extraction pipe speed)

    * The CraftFurnace has a 6 stack input and output buffer, 3 slots for fuel, and smelts 2 items at a time. It is also more fuel efficient and saves progress if you run out of fuel during smelting.

# Magical Life

## Uncategorized Tips

* Rock bees will need the Normal humidity and temperature of the Underground dimension, while the Hot and Wet bees do not carry the Cave Dweller gene. You will most likely need to crossbreed many Hot and Wet bees to get a pure Rock princess and drone. When a species mutation occurs, the bee's traits will be set to the species’ defaults. Since Hot+Wet has a 50% chance to mutate to Rock, there is a 25% chance that a Rock bee will be usable.

* It's sometimes best to wait until you can make soul frames before you start bees, as this one item makes just about every mutation a success.  Without access to gendustry, this will greatly speed up your bee breeding.

* An Industrial Apiary is an effective way of dealing with climate issues.

* If you want to dive deeply into bee breeding before Gendustry, automating the crossbreeding and purification processes is possible with buildcraft pipes.  A gravity pipe will remove princesses and drones along with their products, and a diamond pipe can sort bees into drones and princesses.  Two hoppers feeding into an Apiary can automate crossbreeding (though you need a princess for each automated crossbreed attempt) and so long as you feed the princess back into the apiary but not the drones, purification is EASILY automated with a supply of 4-6 purebred drones.  If you feed both the drone and the princess back in, you can automate production of drones and combs; this does not require a diamond pipe, only a clay pipe.

# Resource Automation

## Uncategorized Tips

## Progression Tips

* The hovering hourglass quest requires you to complete the botania structure quest in Magical Life

* When travelling to Exoria Underground, make sure to bring torches. The portal spawns in complete darkness so try to light the area up before the grue kills you.

* Adding Silk Touch (2 slime blocks, 2 wool, 4 emerald, and a brick) to a Flexible tool allows you to get 4 cinis clay per block, so you only need to find 9 blocks for a coke oven.

# Power up

## Uncategorized Tips

* Magneticraft power will convert to RF

* The Thermal Expansion's Spruce tree > fractionating still > compression dynamo producing steam > steam dynamo setup is a relatively cheap way to passively produce 1200 RF/t (note: you will either need more than one steam dynamo, or one that’s highly upgraded)

* Skip the Ember Activator and go straight to the Pressure Refinery. Give it a few buckets of water and your ember will last longer.

# Tech Progression

## Uncategorized Tips

* Poison extract is harvested from mature sponge plants in the mist. The correct sponge will have a recess on the top that you can harvest the poison from. This can also be accelerated using a watering can (possibly other methods?) *note: the sponge life cycle starts with a stalk which grows big, pops open at the top to reveal the recess, then develops a green nodule that blocks the recess. Once the nodule is formed, the sponge slowly consumes itself while spreading spores.  If you keep collecting the poison extract the nodule will not form, preserving your sponge.

* Futurepack component RNG

    * Most parts from Futurepack have varying qualities which are randomly generated when crafted. Because the same quality components stack, you can cheese the RNG to always receive a specific quality part. When crafting the component, fill your inventory with other items and only leave one space for the part you want. Then just spam shift-click when crafting and you will only make that quality part.
